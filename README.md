To practice the plotting techniques you have learned so far, you will be making a graphic 
that explores relationships between variables. This practice is useful since we will later 
cover creating reproducible graphics in this class. You will be looking at a subset of a 
United States medical expenditures dataset with information on costs for different medical 
conditions and in different areas of the country.

Questions:

1. What is the relationship between mean covered charges (Average.Covered.Charges) and mean total 
payments (Average.Total.Payments) in New York?
2. How does the relationship between mean covered charges (Average.Covered.Charges) and mean total 
payments (Average.Total.Payments) vary by medical condition (DRG.Definition) and the state in which 
care was received (Provider.State)?
